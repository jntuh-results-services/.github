# JNTUH Results Services

Collection of _truly_ Open-source Micro-Services, Backend Applications and,
Front-End Clients to provide JNTUH Engineering Results.

We are Open Source enthusiasts aiming to solve issues that students face with
our [University](https://jntuh.ac.in/) Examination [Results
Portal](results.jntuh.ac.in/).

Currently, we have the following repositories that provide Undergraduate
Engineering Results:

- **[JNTUH Results Statistics Web Application](https://github.com/jntuh-results-services/jntuh-results-stats)**
- **[SGPA Calculator Mobile Application](https://github.com/jntuh-results-services/sgpa-calculator)**
- **[Results REST-API](https://github.com/jntuh-results-services/sgpa-rest-api)**

Extensive **[API
Documentation](hemanthk.me/sgpa-rest-api-docs/)**
is also provided to use the REST-API.

All our clients and services are licensed under
[GPL-V3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) ensuring that the work
produced here, and its derivatives remain truly Open Source.


Soon, we also plan to extend our applications and services to provide results
for streams such as B.Pharmacy and also based on the request of students and
teachers along with new features.
